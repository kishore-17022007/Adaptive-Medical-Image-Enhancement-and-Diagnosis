Adaptive Medical Image Enhancement and Diagnosis
### Using Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Reinforcement Learning

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on developing an **intelligent adaptive medical image enhancement and diagnostic system** that utilizes **Machine Learning (ML)**, **Deep Learning (DL)**, and **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** to improve medical image clarity and aid in early, accurate disease detection.

The system dynamically adjusts enhancement parameters based on image characteristics, ensuring optimal visibility for diagnostic regions of interest. It integrates automated **disease detection** pipelines for conditions like **pneumonia** and **COVID-19**, leveraging state-of-the-art AI models.
